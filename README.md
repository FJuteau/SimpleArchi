# SimpleArchi

## To improve
- Testing helpers
- Better UI
- SplitView for iPad
- Real design system (primary button is used twice in the app right now)
- Fix strange constraint issue on FilterViewController
- If we don't have categories from backend, the app should be able to run without this feature 
- Reachability
- Fix the glitch when scrolling quickly. We would need to implement cancellation mechanism on image downloader
- Certainly more :)
